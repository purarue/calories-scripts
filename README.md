# calories-fzf

A `fzf` interface to [`calories`](https://github.com/zupzup/calories), to add something you've eaten in the past again.

As you add more things to calories using `calories add <cal> '<name>'`, this picks them up using `calories export`.

## Install

Download the `calfzf` script, make it executable and put it on your `$PATH`. Can also use sinister:

`sh <(curl -sSL http://git.io/sinister) -u 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seanbreckenridge/calories-fzf/master/calfzf'`
